Motivation
 
No one is a stranger to To-do-lists. They help us plan out our activities for the week ahead and provide us with a means of staying organized and on task. However, many of us end up using ones which fall short in providing certain desirable features. As a result, we often see ourselves jumping between multiple applications in order to keep track of even the simplest tasks. This poses a serious issue as using these applications now becomes counter-productive.

 
Aim
 
As such, we hope to give users more autonomy in how they want to record and track their daily tasks to boost their user experience and productivity.

Scope of Project
A web app that grants greater autonomy to users on how they plan their activities.

Tickaholic is a web app that strives for a balance between power and minimalism. It is catered to both power users and lightweight users. Power users, who are hungry for more control of their daily tasks, can allocate time to do a task and track their progress in detail. On the other hand, lightweight users can simply use Tickaholic to stay posted on what tasks they have on hand and ensure they stick to their deadlines. 

Features
The following is a list of key features which our web application will provide:
Standard task system - Allow users to add, update and delete tasks
Subtask system - Break down larger tasks to digestible components
Filter & Sorting system - Customizable view settings to suit user’s needs
Custom Properties - Users can add To-do dates to better plan their week or add their own tags to tasks
List system - Allow users to create multiple groups of tasks
Progress Bar - Allow a user to gauge how much of the task he/she has completed
Interactive in-app Calendar - Allows users to update the timeline of a task without directly accessing the task node
